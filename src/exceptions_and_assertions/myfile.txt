An exception can be thrown from the block of code associated with the try-with-resources statement. 
In the example writeToFileZipFileContents, an exception can be thrown from the try block,
 and up to two exceptions can be thrown from the try-with-resources statement when it 
 tries to close the ZipFile and BufferedWriter objects. If an exception is thrown from the try 
 block and one or more exceptions are thrown from the try-with-resources statement, then those 
 exceptions thrown from the try-with-resources statement are suppressed, and the exception thrown by the 
 block is the one that is thrown by the writeToFileZipFileContents method. You can retrieve these suppressed 
 exceptions by calling the Throwable.getSuppressed method from the exception thrown by the try block.
